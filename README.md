# Double-Pendulum Using Cinder/C++

This is a simple Double Pendulum project written in C++ using [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/ "Cinder") library.
#### Controls
You can tweak different parameters (such as gravity, length, colors etc.) using the control panel provided in the software (lower left corner).
There are also a couple of controling items such as pausing the animation.
#### CMakeFile
The CMakeFile provided here would need some adjusting before you can compile the project in your system.

###### This is my first project using vscode, so expect a few bizzare commits in this repo
